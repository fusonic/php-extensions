## About

This bundle contains a variety of extensions for the 
[Symfony HttpKernel component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel.html). See below for details on
each extension this bundle provides and how it works.

Currently primary development takes place at a private repository at GitLab.com. The project on GitHub.com is updated
regularly, but does not include any issues managed at GitLab. However, we are happily accepting issues and pull requests
on GitHub as well! Feel free to open an issue or merge request. If we see broader community engagement in the future, we
may consider switching our primary development to GitHub.
